Assumes user will set two environment variables:

DMSTACK_DIR = location of the DMStack installation
We are currently using the Winter2013 Beta but Summer2012 should work as well

LSSTSCRIPT_DIR = location of the test_scripts directory obtained from git repo:
git@git.lsstcorp.org:LSST/Camera/Sensors/test_scripts

Once those variables are set, do:
source setup.sh

This will update your environment to use the DMstack and the analysis scripts.

This directory also contains examples to run two examples:
fe55_gain and read_noise
Users can view the contents of those scripts for clues on running at the 
command line or edit the scripts directly and use them.
